"""
Description: This script represents the distributor module responsible for fetching goods information from each 
manufacturer's API. It uses the requests library to make HTTP GET requests to each manufacturer's /goods endpoint. 
The retrieved goods information is stored in a list for further processing.

In this example, the manufacturer_endpoints list contains the URLs of the manufacturers' APIs. 
You can add as many manufacturers as needed by including their respective endpoints.

The fetch_goods_information() function iterates over the manufacturer endpoints, retrieves the goods information 
from each manufacturer's API, and appends it to the goods_information list. 
You can further process or combine this information based on your specific requirements.

Remember to handle exceptions, error handling, and data processing according to your application's needs.

By following this approach, the distributor can communicate with each manufacturer's API separately, 
retrieve the goods information, and combine it as required. This allows the distributor to have a centralized 
view of the available goods from all manufacturers.
